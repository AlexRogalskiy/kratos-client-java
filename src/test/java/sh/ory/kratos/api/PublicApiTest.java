It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in &#x60;choose_method&#x60; state. &#x60;passed_challenge&#x60; expects a &#x60;token&#x60; to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\&quot;sending a recovery link\&quot;) does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.
